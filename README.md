# CodebookAI

CodebookAI is a powerful text classification application that leverages OpenAI's language models to perform a variety of tasks - primarily to automatically categorize text snippets into predefined labels. The application supports both batch processing for large datasets and real-time processing for immediate results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### System Dependencies
CodebookAI requires tkinter for the graphical interface:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

**CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install tkinter
```

**macOS/Windows:**
tkinter is included with Python installations

### Python Dependencies
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### 1. First Launch
Run the application:
```bash
python ui/main_window.py
```

### 2. Configure API Key
1. Click the **Settings** button (âš™) in the top-right corner
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Optionally adjust other settings (model, timezone, etc.)
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Prepare Your Data
Create two CSV files:
- **Labels CSV**: One column containing your classification categories
- **Quotes CSV**: One column containing text snippets to classify

Example labels.csv:
```csv
label
Positive
Negative
Neutral
```

Example quotes.csv:
```csv
text
"This product is amazing!"
"I hate this service"
"It's okay, nothing special"
```

### 4. Run Classification

#### For Batch Processing (Recommended for large datasets):
1. Click the **Add** button (ï¼‹) to create a new batch
2. Select your labels CSV file
3. Select your quotes CSV file
4. Monitor progress in the "Ongoing Batches" tab
5. Download results when complete

#### For Live Processing (Small datasets):
1. Click the **Tools** button (ðŸ› )
2. Select "Live Process"
3. Select your labels and quotes CSV files
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Save results when prompted

## Usage Guide

### Understanding the Interface

- **Tools Button (ðŸ› )**: Access live processing and other utilities
- **Settings Button (âš™)**: Configure API key, model, and preferences  
- **Add Button (ï¼‹)**: Create new batch classification jobs
- **Refresh Button (â†»)**: Update batch job status lists

### Batch Processing Workflow

1. **Create Batch**: Click Add (ï¼‹) and select your CSV files
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch status in "Ongoing Batches" tab
3. **Check Completion**: Completed jobs move to "Done Batches" tab
4. **Download Results**: Right-click completed batches and select "Download"

### Managing Batch Jobs

- **Cancel**: Right-click ongoing batches to cancel if needed
- **Download**: Right-click completed batches to save results
- **Refresh**: Click refresh (â†») to update status information

## Configuration

### Settings Options

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (stored securely)
- **Model**: AI model to use (default: o3)
- **Max Batches**: Number of recent batches to display (default: 4)
- **Timezone**: Timezone for displaying batch creation times
