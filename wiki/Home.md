# CodebookAI Wiki

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **CodebookAI** - a powerful qualitative research tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to assist researchers in processing large text datasets efficiently and cost-effectively.

## üéØ What is CodebookAI?

CodebookAI is designed to assist qualitative researchers in processing large datasets through OpenAI's GPT models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, etc.). It provides both live and batch processing capabilities for text classification, significantly reducing the cost and time associated with manual coding while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Live Processing
- **Single Label Classification**: Classify text snippets with exactly one label from your predefined set
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Assign multiple relevant labels to each text snippet
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract meaningful keywords from text data with AI assistance

### üì¶ Batch Processing  
- **Cost-Effective Processing**: Leverage OpenAI's batch API for [significant cost savings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)
- **Large Dataset Support**: Process thousands of text snippets efficiently
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Submit jobs and retrieve results when ready

### üìä Data Analysis Tools
- **Reliability Statistics**: Calculate Cohen's Kappa and percentage agreement between two coders
- **Correlograms**: Generate visual correlation matrices to analyze label relationships
