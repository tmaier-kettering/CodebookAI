# CodebookAI Wiki

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **CodebookAI** - a powerful qualitative research tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to assist researchers in processing large text datasets efficiently and cost-effectively.

## üéØ What is CodebookAI?

CodebookAI is designed to assist qualitative researchers in processing large datasets through OpenAI's GPT models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, etc.). It provides both live and batch processing capabilities for text classification, significantly reducing the cost and time associated with manual coding while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Live Processing
- **Single Label Classification**: Classify text snippets with exactly one label from your predefined set
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Assign multiple relevant labels to each text snippet
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract meaningful keywords from text data with AI assistance

### üì¶ Batch Processing  
- **Cost-Effective Processing**: Leverage OpenAI's batch API for significant cost savings (up to 50% off standard rates)
- **Large Dataset Support**: Process thousands of text snippets efficiently
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Submit jobs and retrieve results when ready

### üìä Data Analysis Tools
- **Reliability Statistics**: Calculate Cohen's Kappa and percentage agreement between two coders
- **Correlograms**: Generate visual correlation matrices to analyze label relationships
- **Statistical Exports**: Save analysis results with comprehensive statistics

### üíæ Data Management
- **Universal Import**: Support for CSV, TSV, TXT, and Excel files
- **Flexible Export**: Save results in multiple formats
- **Data Validation**: Built-in validation and preview capabilities

### üé® User-Friendly Interface
- **Intuitive GUI**: Clean, modern interface built with Tkinter
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators for long-running operations
- **Wizard-Based Workflows**: Step-by-step guides for complex operations
