# Best Practices Guide

This guide distills expert knowledge and community wisdom to help you get the most out of CodebookAI. Following these practices will improve accuracy, reduce costs, and streamline your research workflow.

## 🎯 Label Design Best Practices

### Creating Effective Label Sets

#### 1. Specificity Over Generality
**Bad Examples:**
- `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`
- `good`, `bad`
- `relevant`, `not_relevant`

**Good Examples:**
- `positive_customer_experience`, `negative_customer_experience`, `neutral_customer_experience`
- `high_quality_product`, `low_quality_product`, `defective_product`
- `actionable_feedback`, `general_comment`, `complaint_resolution_needed`

#### 2. Mutual Exclusivity (for Single-Label Tasks)
Each text should clearly belong to exactly one category:

**Problematic (Overlapping):**
```
urgent
important  
high_priority
critical
```

**Better (Distinct):**
```
immediate_action_required    # Must be done today
scheduled_follow_up         # Can wait 1-7 days  
general_information        # No action needed
archived_reference         # Historical record only
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
Ensure your label set covers all expected content:

**Incomplete:**
```
technical_issue
billing_question
```

**Complete:**
```
technical_issue
billing_question
account_management
product_inquiry
service_complaint
general_feedback
other_inquiry
```

### Multi-Label Design Principles

#### 1. Orthogonal Dimensions
Design labels that capture different aspects:

**Content Dimensions:**
```
# Topic
financial, technical, marketing, legal, operational

# Sentiment  
positive_tone, negative_tone, neutral_tone

# Urgency
immediate, scheduled, background

# Stakeholder
customer_facing, internal_process, regulatory, strategic
```

#### 2. Avoid Redundant Labels
**Redundant:**
```
urgent, high_priority, immediate, critical, asap
```

**Streamlined:**
```
urgent, medium_priority, low_priority
```

### Label Naming Conventions

#### 1. Consistent Formatting
- **Use underscores**: `customer_service` not `customer service` or `customer-service`
- **Lowercase**: `technical_issue` not `Technical_Issue`
- **No special characters**: Avoid punctuation, numbers at start

#### 2. Descriptive Names
- **Clear meaning**: `product_defect_report` vs `bad_product`
- **Unambiguous**: `quarterly_financial_report` vs `report`
- **Professional**: `regulatory_compliance` vs `rules_stuff`

## 📊 Data Preparation Excellence

### Text Data Quality

#### 1. Clean Text Content
**Before Processing:**
```python
# Remove excess whitespace
text = ' '.join(text.split())

# Handle special characters appropriately
text = text.replace('\n', ' ').replace('\t', ' ')

# Remove or replace problematic characters
text = text.replace('"', "'").replace(',', ' ')
```

#### 2. Optimal Text Length
- **Sweet spot**: 50-500 words per text snippet
- **Too short**: Single words or phrases lack context
- **Too long**: >1000 words may dilute classification accuracy
- **Solution**: Split long documents into logical segments

#### 3. Consistent Structure
Ensure all text samples have similar characteristics:
- **Similar sources**: Don't mix formal documents with casual social media
- **Similar length**: Wide variations can affect accuracy
- **Similar context**: Group related content types together

### Data Organization

#### 1. File Structure
```
project_name/
├── data/
│   ├── labels/
│   │   ├── sentiment_labels.csv
│   │   └── topic_labels.csv
│   ├── text/
│   │   ├── survey_responses_2024.csv
│   │   └── interview_transcripts_2024.csv
│   └── results/
│       ├── live_processing/
│       └── batch_processing/
├── documentation/
└── analysis/
```

#### 2. Naming Conventions
- **Descriptive filenames**: `customer_feedback_q1_2024.csv`
- **Version control**: `labels_v2_revised.csv`
- **Date stamps**: `processed_2024_01_15.csv`
- **Consistent format**: Use same pattern across project

#### 3. Documentation
Keep detailed records:
- **Data sources**: Where did the text come from?
- **Processing history**: What transformations were applied?
- **Label definitions**: Exact meaning of each label
- **Quality notes**: Any issues or limitations discovered

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies

### Model Selection Strategy

#### 1. Progressive Testing
```
Phase 1: Test with gpt-4o-mini (cheapest)
↓
Phase 2: Validate sample with gpt-4o 
↓
Phase 3: Production with optimal model
```

#### 2. Model-Task Matching
- **Simple sentiment**: gpt-4o-mini is often sufficient
- **Complex thematic analysis**: gpt-4o provides better nuance
- **Multi-dimensional coding**: gpt-4-turbo for highest accuracy
- **Specialized reasoning**: o1-preview when available

#### 3. Cost-Quality Balance
Calculate cost per correctly classified item:
```
Model A: 90% accuracy at $1.00 per 1000 items = $1.11 per 1000 correct
Model B: 95% accuracy at $2.50 per 1000 items = $2.63 per 1000 correct

Consider: Is 5% accuracy improvement worth 137% cost increase?
```

### Processing Method Optimization

#### 1. Live vs Batch Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| < 100 items | Live | Setup overhead not worth batch savings |
| 100-500 items | Live or Batch | Depends on urgency and budget |
| 500-5000 items | Batch | Significant cost savings |
| > 5000 items | Batch | Substantial savings, manage in chunks |
| Testing labels | Live | Need immediate feedback |
| Production run | Batch | Optimize for cost |

#### 2. Batch Size Optimization
- **Sweet spot**: 1000-3000 items per batch
- **Too small**: Don't get full batch discount
- **Too large**: May take very long or fail
- **Multiple batches**: Better than one enormous batch

### Token Usage Optimization

#### 1. Efficient Text Preparation
- **Remove boilerplate**: Strip standard headers/footers
- **Combine similar**: Group very short texts together
- **Essential content**: Focus on text that actually needs classification
- **Format cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, excessive whitespace

#### 2. Label Efficiency
- **Fewer labels**: More labels = more complex prompts = higher cost
- **Clear labels**: Ambiguous labels require more processing
- **Consistent naming**: Reduces prompt complexity

## 🔬 Quality Assurance Methods

### Validation Strategies

#### 1. Ground Truth Validation
Create a "gold standard" dataset:
1. **Expert coding**: Have domain experts manually classify 100-500 items
2. **Multiple coders**: Use 2-3 coders for reliability
3. **Consensus building**: Resolve disagreements through discussion
4. **AI comparison**: Test AI performance against this standard

#### 2. Progressive Validation
```
Sample 50 → Test → Refine labels → 
Sample 200 → Test → Adjust model → 
Sample 500 → Final validation → 
Full dataset processing
```

#### 3. Inter-rater Reliability
- **Cohen's Kappa target**: Aim for κ > 0.70 for research quality
- **Percentage agreement**: Should be >80% for most applications
- **Document disagreements**: Understand why classifications differ

### Quality Control Workflows

#### 1. Systematic Sampling
Don't just check the first few results:
- **Random sampling**: Check randomly selected items
- **Stratified sampling**: Check examples from each label category
- **Edge cases**: Specifically review difficult or ambiguous cases
- **Consistent checking**: Use same validation approach throughout

#### 2. Error Pattern Analysis
Look for systematic problems:
- **Label confusion**: Which labels are often confused?
- **Text patterns**: What types of text cause errors?
- **Model limitations**: Where does the chosen model struggle?
- **Data quality**: Are errors due to poor text quality?

#### 3. Iterative Improvement
Use validation results to improve:
- **Refine labels**: Make unclear labels more specific
- **Update definitions**: Clarify label meanings
- **Model selection**: Switch models if needed
- **Data cleaning**: Improve text preparation
