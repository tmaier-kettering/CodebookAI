# Single Label Classification Tool (Batch)

## Accessing Single Label Classification Tool (Batch)
**Navigate**: LLM Tools > Batch Methods > Single Label Classification

## Single Label Classification Purpose
The Single Label Classification tool allows you to classify text data into one of several predefined categories using a language model. This is useful for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic categorization, or any scenario where you need to assign a single label to each piece of text based on its content.
This is the batch version and thus will take up to 24 hours to process using the OpenAI API.
You can check the progress by refresh the Batches table on the main window.

## Using the Single Label Classification Tool
1. The import wizard will appear twice: first to request the labels and second to request the text data.
2. For each import, select which column you want to use for the labels and text data, respectively.
3. The Dataset field is used to name your batch elements for easy identification later on the Batches table on the main window.

Accepted file types: csv, tsv, Excel, and Parquet
