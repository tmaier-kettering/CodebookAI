# Keyword Extraction Tool (Batch)

## Accessing Keyword Extraction Tool (Batch)
**Navigate**: LLM Tools > Batch Methods > Keyword Extraction

## Keyword Extraction Purpose
The Keyword Extraction tool allows you to extract key phrases or terms from text data using a language model. This is useful for tasks such as summarizing content, identifying important topics, or enhancing search functionality by highlighting relevant keywords.
This is the batch version and thus will take up to 24 hours to process using the OpenAI API.
You can check the progress by refresh the Batches table on the main window.

## Using the Keyword Extraction Tool
1. The import wizard will appear once to request the text data.
2. Select which column contains the text data you want to extract keywords from.
3. The Dataset field is used to name your batch elements for easy identification later on the Batches table on the main window.

Accepted file types: csv, tsv, Excel, and Parquet
