## Accessing Multi-Label Classification Tool (Batch)
**Navigate**: LLM Tools > Batch Methods > Multi-Label Classification

## Multi-Label Classification Purpose
The Multi-Label Classification tool allows you to classify text data into one or more of several predefined categories using a language model. This is useful for tasks such as thematic analysis, topic categorization, or any scenario where you need to assign a one or more labels to each piece of text based on its content.
This is the batch version and thus will take up to 24 hours to process using the OpenAI API.
You can check the progress by refresh the Batches table on the main window.

## Using the Multi-Label Classification Tool
1. The import wizard will appear twice: first to request the labels and second to request the text data.
2. For each import, select which column you want to use for the labels and text data, respectively.
3. The Dataset field is used to name your batch elements for easy identification later on the Batches table on the main window.

Accepted file types: csv, tsv, Excel, and Parquet
