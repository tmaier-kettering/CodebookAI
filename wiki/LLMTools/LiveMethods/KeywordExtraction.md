## Accessing Keyword Extraction Tool (Live)
**Navigate**: LLM Tools > Live Methods > Keyword Extraction

## Keyword Extraction Purpose
The Keyword Extraction tool allows you to extract key phrases or terms from text data using a language model. This is useful for tasks such as summarizing content, identifying important topics, or enhancing search functionality by highlighting relevant keywords.
This is the live version and thus will process data in real-time using the OpenAI API.

## Using the Keyword Extraction Tool
1. The import wizard will appear once to request the text data.
2. Select which column contains the text data you want to extract keywords from.
3. The Dataset field is not used for this tool, so you can ignore it.

Accepted file types: csv, tsv, Excel, and Parquet
