# Single Label Classification Tool (Live)

## Accessing Single Label Classification Tool (Live)
**Navigate**: LLM Tools > Live Methods > Single Label Classification

## Single Label Classification Purpose
The Single Label Classification tool allows you to classify text data into one of several predefined categories using a language model. This is useful for tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic categorization, or any scenario where you need to assign a single label to each piece of text based on its content.
This is the live version and thus will process data in real-time using the OpenAI API.

## Using the Single Label Classification Tool
1. The import wizard will appear twice: first to request the labels and second to request the text data.
2. For each import, select which column you want to use for the labels and text data, respectively.
3. The Dataset field is not used for this tool, so you can ignore it.

Accepted file types: csv, tsv, Excel, and Parquet
